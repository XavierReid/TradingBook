## What it does
Visualizes trading between different stocks (i.e. Google, Facebook, and Oracle).
Shows a graph representation of the total number of shares resting in the selected stockâ€™s book at each price. Buy side bars are colored blue, and sell side bars are colored red.
Allows users to submit orders, which are then either executed against an order that is resting on the opposite side or it is added to the book.
All trades that have been executed are displayed in a table underneath the tradebook visual.
