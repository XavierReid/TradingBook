Order:
- stock it belongs to (aka alphanumeric code called "ticker") 
    - ex. Apple Inc. == AAPL
- "side" the order is on (aka buying or selling)
- price
- number of shares 

Book:
- unique to each stock's ticker
- when 1st order is added, shares "rest" on the book
    - "rests" on either the buy side or the sell side
- subsequent orders are checked against the shares resting
on the opposite "side" (i.e. buy -> sell & sell --> buy)

An incoming order is executed when its price matches or “crosses”
the “top of the book” on the opposite side.
    - "top of the book" for buy == highest price
    - "top of the book" for sell == lowest price


when a new order "crosses" the "top of the book" on the opposite "side"
    - new order is executed
    - "top of the book" is removed from the book
    - when the prices cross, the incoming order is executed at the price of the resting shares
    - "crosses" for buy side == price of buy > price of sell for "top of the book"
    - "crosses" for sell side == price of sell < price of buy for "top of the book"
    - ex. if Amy places an order to buy 100 shares at AAPL at $101.00, 
    and Bob subsequently places an order to sell 100 shares AAPL at $100, 
    Bob’s order will execute against Amy’s order, and execution price will be $101.00.

when an incoming order matches or crosses a resting order on the opposite side with a smaller number of shares,
the resting order is removed from the book and the excess shares of the incoming order are added to the book. 
Conversely, when an incoming order matches or crosses a resting order with a bigger number of shares,
the incoming order partially executes the resting order, and the number of shares of the resting order is decreased 
the number of shares in the incoming order. 


ex. of workflow:
9:00 AM: Amy sends an order to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $101.53 (added to the book)
9:01 AM: Bob sends an order to sell 200 shares of AAPL at $102.47 (added to the book)
9:02 AM: Charlie sends and order to sell 100 shares of AAPL at $101.60 (added to the book)
9:03 AM: Dan sends an order to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $101.70 (this crosses Charlie’s order, and both are fully executed at $101.60)
9:04 AM: Emma sends an order to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $101.60 (added to the book)
9:05 AM: Fred sends an order to sell 200 shares of AAPL at $101.60 (this matches Emma’s order, and they are executed at $101.60; Emma’s order is executed fully, while Fred’s order is executed partially and the excess shares are added to the book)
